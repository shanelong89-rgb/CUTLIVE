# CULTIVE — App Store Launch Plan

Everything needed to get the mobile app into the App Store / Play Store, properly connected to cultive.city, with web and mobile fully cohesive.

---

## What's already working

### Core infrastructure
- Web app is live at cultive.city (Vercel)
- Web and mobile both point to the same Supabase project (`qmjdqldmpmeguuyepbsw`)
- Auth, saved events, submissions, inbox, and push notifications share the same DB
- Sessions persist across app restarts (AsyncStorage)
- Admin emails fixed to match web: `shanelong89@gmail.com`, `shanelong@gmail.com`
- `expo-router` origin set to `https://cultive.city`

### Events & discovery
- Events list with search and tag/category filtering
- Event detail screen (title, description, venue, date, time, price, photo)
- Saved events with full cloud sync (`saved_events` table, real-time on mobile)
- In-memory events cache + React Query `staleTime: 5min` — reduces Supabase reads on every tab switch

### Inbox
All four card types are working on both web and mobile:
- **Submission pending** — shows when a submission is awaiting review
- **Submission approved** — unread badge reappears when status changes; links to event
- **Submission rejected** — with reason; links to My Submissions
- **Saved event reminders** — four escalating states:
  - "Reminder: [title]" — generic upcoming (days away)
  - "Tomorrow: [title]" — with time, venue, price + Maps link
  - "Starting in Xh: [title]" — within 2 hours, with Maps link
  - "Happening now: [title]" — single-day event, with Maps link
  - "On now: [title] · Nd left" — multi-day exhibitions/markets, shows hours + venue + days remaining
- Date parsing handles all formats: ISO (`2026-05-23`), month-name (`May 8, 2026`), range (`May 8–27, 2026`), relative (`today`, `tomorrow`), and weekday-prefixed (`Fri 13 Jun`)
- Multi-day events use `date_end` so they stay visible for the full run, not just 14 days after start
- Self-triggered `load()` loop suppressed via 3s cooldown on `user_read_items` realtime events
- Push notification deep-link handler wired in `_layout.tsx` — tapping a push opens the right inbox card

### Submissions
- Submit screen with image upload to Supabase Storage (`submission-images` bucket, public)
- My Submissions screen — lists all user submissions with status badges (pending / approved / rejected)
- Submission count on Account screen reflects actual count by session email

### Admin
- Admin screen accessible to admin emails only
- Can approve / reject submissions from mobile

---

## What's still to do before App Store

### Code / functionality
- [ ] **Cross-app inbox read/unread sync** — when a user marks all read on web, it should propagate to mobile on next refresh (and vice versa). Currently, `user_read_items` deletions (un-reads from status changes) aren't pushed to Supabase, so after a status flip the "unread" state can drift between devices. Fix: `deleteReadItemsRemote` helper + port status-change unread logic to web hook.
- [ ] **Auto-fill submitter email/name** on mobile submit form — pre-populate from active Supabase session so submission count is always tied to the right account.

### App Store setup
- [ ] **Update bundle ID** in `app.json` from `com.replit.cultivemobile` → `city.cultive.app`
- [ ] **EAS setup** — run `eas build:configure` to generate `eas.json`
- [ ] **EAS secrets** — add `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in expo.dev dashboard
- [ ] **Universal Links** — AASA file on Vercel + `associatedDomains` in `app.json`
- [ ] **First EAS production build** — `eas build --platform ios --profile production`
- [ ] **Android signing** — get SHA256 from `eas credentials`, add to `assetlinks.json`
- [ ] **Submit** — `eas submit --platform ios` / `eas submit --platform android`

---

## Step 1 — Fix bundle identifiers (do this first)

The current bundle IDs are placeholders (`com.replit.cultivemobile`). Before submitting to any store you need real ones.

**In `app.json`, update:**
```json
"ios": {
  "bundleIdentifier": "city.cultive.app"
},
"android": {
  "package": "city.cultive.app"
}
```

Use `city.cultive.app` — mirrors your domain in reverse (standard convention).

---

## Step 2 — Set up EAS (Expo Application Services)

EAS is the official way to build and submit Expo apps to the stores.

**Run once in your terminal:**
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login          # log in with your Expo account (expo.dev)
cd artifacts/cultive-mobile
eas build:configure   # creates eas.json
```

**The `eas.json` it creates should look like this:**
```json
{
  "cli": { "version": ">= 10.0.0" },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {}
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

---

## Step 3 — Environment variables for production builds

The mobile app reads Supabase credentials from env vars. For EAS builds these must be set in the EAS dashboard, not in a `.env` file.

**Go to**: expo.dev → your project → Secrets → Add

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL       = https://qmjdqldmpmeguuyepbsw.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  = <your anon key from Supabase dashboard>
```

---

## Step 4 — Universal Links (cultive.city URLs open the app)

This lets links like `cultive.city/event/abc123` open directly in the installed app instead of the browser.

### 4a — Add the AASA file to your web domain

On your Vercel project, add a file at exactly this path:
```
public/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
```

Content:
```json
{
  "applinks": {
    "apps": [],
    "details": [
      {
        "appID": "QU9S49M4Y6.city.cultive.app",
        "paths": ["*"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "webcredentials": {
    "apps": ["QU9S49M4Y6.city.cultive.app"]
  }
}
```

### 4b — Enable Associated Domains in app.json

```json
"ios": {
  "bundleIdentifier": "city.cultive.app",
  "associatedDomains": ["applinks:cultive.city", "webcredentials:cultive.city"]
}
```

### 4c — Android App Links

Create `public/.well-known/assetlinks.json` on your web domain:
```json
[{
  "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
  "target": {
    "namespace": "android_app",
    "package_name": "city.cultive.app",
    "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["<YOUR_SIGNING_KEY_SHA256>"]
  }
}]
```
The SHA256 fingerprint comes from your EAS build keystore — get it after your first production build with `eas credentials`.

---

## Step 5 — Apple Developer & Google Play accounts

- **Apple** ✓ — Account active. Credentials on file:
  - Team ID: `QU9S49M4Y6`
  - Developer ID: `c2388d89-44db-427a-aea3-7d2e58225073`
  - `appleTeamId` already added to `app.json`
- **Google** — play.google.com/console, one-time $25 fee if not already set up.

---

## Step 6 — Build and submit

```bash
# iOS production build + submit to App Store Connect
eas build --platform ios --profile production
eas submit --platform ios

# Android production build + submit to Play Store
eas build --platform android --profile production
eas submit --platform android
```

---

## Step 7 — Cohesion checklist (web ↔ mobile)

| Feature | Web | Mobile | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Supabase project | `qmjdqldmpmeguuyepbsw` | `qmjdqldmpmeguuyepbsw` | Same ✓ |
| Auth provider | Supabase email/password | Supabase email/password | Same ✓ |
| Session storage | localStorage | AsyncStorage | Platform-appropriate ✓ |
| Saved events sync | `saved_events` table | `saved_events` table | Same ✓ |
| Events cache | 2-layer (in-memory + localStorage, 10min TTL) | In-memory + React Query 5min staleTime | Platform-appropriate ✓ |
| Submission flow | `submissions` table, status enum | `submissions` table, status enum | Same ✓ |
| My Submissions screen | `/my-submissions` page | `app/my-submissions.tsx` | Both ✓ |
| Inbox — submission cards | Pending / Approved / Rejected | Pending / Approved / Rejected | Same ✓ |
| Inbox — saved reminders | All 5 types (generic, tomorrow, soon, now, multi-day) | All 5 types | Same ✓ |
| Inbox — Maps links | Tomorrow + now/soon cards | Tomorrow + now/soon cards | Same ✓ |
| Inbox — read state | `user_read_items` table + localStorage | `user_read_items` table + AsyncStorage | Same ✓ |
| Inbox — self-loop fix | 3s cooldown on realtime write events | 3s cooldown on realtime write events | Same ✓ |
| Push notifications | n/a (web) | Expo Push via `push_tokens` table | Mobile-only ✓ |
| Push deep-link | n/a | Handled in `_layout.tsx` | Mobile-only ✓ |
| Admin access | Admin page (`/admin`) | Admin screen (`app/admin.tsx`) | Both ✓ |

### Cross-device check (do before launch)

Sign in on web → confirm events, submissions, and inbox load. Then sign in with the **same account** on mobile and confirm:
- Saved events match
- Inbox shows the same submissions with same read state
- Submission count on Account screen matches
